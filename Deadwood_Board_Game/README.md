This program is a digital version of the board game Deadwood by Cheapass Games. It was completed for an Object Oriented Programming
class in June 2018. It was programmed in Java, and it was discussed & developed throughout the class. Our two man team was 
responsible for the entire design of the implementation including classes, class diagram, objects, user diagrams, sequence diagrams,
and use cases. 

We were provided assets and XML files with details of the assets which we parsed for use in our program. The GUI version presented 
in the Demo was developed using Swing. The game can be played with 2-8 players. It will adjust the correct parameters for
different player counts as dictated by the rule book. Our project received a perfect score.

#### Game Info:
Deadwood is a board game wherein players take the role of actors and go around increasing their fame, fortune, and rank. 
The game mixes chance with some strategy for players to compete to get the highest score. While the player canâ€™t control 
the dice roll used for payout, they can choose where to go and what to do with their fame and fortune. The game has a western
theme to it and the character designs are cartoonish and stylized.
