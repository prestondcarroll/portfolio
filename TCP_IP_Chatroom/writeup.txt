2.) I have tested this program a lot with my own clients and with other people. Mine was compatible with another students so I believe most every thing is working. I was receiving errors with accept for a while and I believe it was because the socklen_t was not initialized (this was part of the demo_server.c). I have not seen that error in a while so I think it is fixed. Earlier, accept would stop accepting connections on the observer port and would never resolve itself. I think the server can handle 255 clients since I ran the provided script and it actually added 255 participants, and then timed them out after a minute.

3.)I tested public messages, private messages, timeouts after a minute of no activity, timeouts after a minute with activity still going through the server, disconnected observers, disconnected participants, reconnected users with same user name, requesting a taken username, putting in long or invalid usernames and other little protocol things. I ran my server with another student and it worked pretty well. The same goes for the participant/observers. I put the max number of clients to 3 and tried connecting a fourth client and it refused it properly. I definitely used gdb to help with this.

4.) Finding a good way to used select efficiently was challenging. You need to make sure things are added to the set and then monitor them and then react in so many different ways. A ton of functions were needed and many things needed to be done in a specific way so it all added up to the challenge. It was difficult getting the timeout done properly. I did not start with using structs when I should have so I had to rework my code to get the timeouts to work with that array of temp clients. It made things not as optimal as I would have liked but at least it worked out.
