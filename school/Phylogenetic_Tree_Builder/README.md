# Phylogenetic Tree Builder

This program first builds a phylogenetic tree by reading in amino acid sequences for each species, and then comparing the sequences to infer the evolutionary relationships. 

The evolutionary distance of any two species is given a weight, and then the hierarchial structure is inferred by using an agglomerative clustering algorithm on the weights.
