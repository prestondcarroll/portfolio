![Video Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prestondcarroll/projects/master/school/Language_Modeler/prog1.mp4)

This Language Modeler is able to "learn" human language given an input file of text. In the video, all of Shakespeare's text is processed and the modeler randomly finishes a sentence from a user's input. The same is done using Grimms' Fairy Tales also. 
"< s >" marks the beginning of a sentence and "< /s >" is the end of the sentence. 

This type of model is an n-gram model where the order, n, effects the sentences that are produced. The lower order sentences are generally more basic.
